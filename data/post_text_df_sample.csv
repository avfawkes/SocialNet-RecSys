463,"China continues breakneck growth

Chinas economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003s 9.1%.

The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. China has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. But officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.

Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. And overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. The result could be higher interest rates. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004.

Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. There is no sign of a slowdown in 2005, said Tim Congdon, economist at ING Barings.

Chinas economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. Figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. Part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, Chinas currency. The government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the US dollar, - much to the chagrin of many US lawmakers who blame China for lost jobs and competitiveness. Despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. We need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time, National Bureau of Statistics chief Li Deshui told Reuters. Those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.

704,"TV station refuses adoption show

A TV station in the US has refused to show a controversial new series where adopted children try and pick their birth father - and win a cash prize.

The WRAZ-TV Fox affiliate in North Carolina was the only one of 182 stations to refuse Mondays show. Whos Your Daddy promises $100,000 (£52,000) to the contestant if she correctly identifies her father. It was met with protests by the National Council for Adoption, which said it exploits sensitive emotions. It exploits the sensitive emotions of adoption, said Thomas Atwood, president of the National Council for Adoption. It trivialises them. Adoption is a very personal, meaningful experience and it should not be commercialised like this. On the pre-taped programme, the contestant is presented with eight men who may or may not be her natural father.

If she picks the correct man from the line-up, the contestant wins the jackpot prize of US$100,000 (£52,590). However, if she picks the wrong man, then the impostor takes the money. Fox producers defended the show, saying it was a positive experience. They have made six specials, though only one episode has so far been broadcast.

The special was thoroughly vetted by our standards and practices department to ensure that it was appropriate for broadcast, said a Fox spokesman. However, any network affiliate that feels the programming may be inappropriate for their individual market has the right to pre-empt the schedule. WRAZ-TV instead chose to air an independently-produced film, I Have Roots and Branches... Personal Reflections on Adoption, a documentary about families with adopted children. We just dont think adoption is a game show, said Tommy Schenck, WRAZ-TVs general manager, though he said his decision had not been influenced by public protests.

751,"Gervais writing Simpsons episode

The Offices Ricky Gervais is writing an episode of hit US cartoon The Simpsons, following an invitation from its creator Matt Groening.

Gervais has already begun writing the script but is keeping its subject matter a closely guarded secret. He will also write a part for himself in the episode. Ive got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career. The Simpsons is the greatest TV show of all time, he said. Groening recently heaped praise on The Office, saying: Everybody on The Simpsons is a fan of The Office - its one of the best shows on TV in the last decade. Gervais has already said he would not guest star in the show as his Office character David, having left him behind for good in the Christmas specials. The Office became a surprise US success when it was screened on cable channel BBC America. The first series won two Golden Globes in 2004 for best comedy and best TV actor for Gervais.

In winning it beat the likes of Sex and the City and Will and Grace. An American version was produced, but so far only a pilot has been broadcast - to much criticism that it failed to live up to the original. At the British Comedy Awards on Wednesday, Gervais was handed a special achievement award for writing. But The Office missed out in the best comedy show category to Little Britain. Matt Groening was also at the awards to collect the award for best international comedy for The Simpsons.

1304,"Tories plan migrant health checks

Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.

A positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. Labour said many tests were already done. The Lib Dems warned both parties against pandering to prejudice.

The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Its very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys, he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad, said Mr Howard.

I dont think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem. But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants claims. The proposals include:

- People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a high incidence TB country will have to undergo a chest X-ray. 
 - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health. 
 - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to impose significant costs or demands on the NHS. 
 - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

There is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected. And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well. The government says the Tories are a bit late to the issue. Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK. Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one. Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status, she said.

2072,"Digital guru floats sub-$100 PC

Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MITs Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).

He told the BBC World Service programme Go Digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. He said one laptop per child could be  very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood. He said the child could use the laptop like a text book. He described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a Linux-based operating system, We have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.

The second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory. The device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. Mr Negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. In 1995 Mr Negroponte published the bestselling Being Digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.

While the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. We put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, its also a TV a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook. Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim were going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but were not talking about doing it in three or five years, were talking about months. He plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the Chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. In China they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. Thats for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education thats cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.

4937,"Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of the greatest actors of his generation, maybe the greatest. This in combination with another amazing actor named Jeff Bridges, it cant be bad. And thats exactly what this movie is! K-PAX is one of the most pleasant surprises of the latest years. To start with has the movie a brilliantly written story. Its part of what makes the movie so great. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the acting. The combination Spacey-Bridges really works.This was already the second time I saw the movie and Im sure it wont be the last time. K-PAX has everything. There are moments which are extremely funny, parts that remind of a true thriller and others which reminds of high-class drama. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and a lot more awards. Great movie! 9/10","movie"
5536,"A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a vivid depiction of a country deeply divided within itself (for further evidence, check out some of the comments on IMDb...!). Compares extremely favourably with Oliver Stones Comandante (which is mainly an in-depth examination of Fidel Castros nostril hairs). I dont know whether Chavez is everything he presents himself as being, or yet another in the long line of populist Latin-American caudillos. Nor do I know whether he will be able to make good on the huge expectations he has clearly built up among the poor majority of Venezuelans. Its hardly reasonable to expect a film like this to be able to answer such questions - but Ive certainly now got a pretty vivid idea of whats at stake, and what it feels like to be caught up in the middle of a coup. Someone says in the film were making history, and thats exactly what the film feels like its capturing. Outstanding stuff.","movie"

Alongside Chaplin,Stan and Ollie,The Marx Bros and.....(fill in your own special favourites)space must be made for everybody connected with Airport 80 - Concorde,the movie. Robert Wagner in particular exceeds all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime.I would never have thought he had it in him. The only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie. British moviegoers will recognise the fat one from Cannon and Ball pretending to be a Russian athlete,a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but,tragically,he couldnt.I have a 14 year old labrador more athletic and almost as funny. George Kennedy - bless him - has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time,and my goodness he triumphs!Brow wrinkled with effort he utters timeless dialogue,each word lovingly polished into Coward-like brilliance. Only once in twenty years does Hollywood turn out a film like Airport 80.All the years of toil and struggle,the sweat,the tears,the lessons with Lee Strasberg,living out of suitcases,born in a trunk etc etc,all come to fruition.A work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on. I think Im ready for my medication now.","movie"
6485,"There are some things I will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example. Similarly, I will never understand this film, and that is brilliant. If you approach this film expecting an actual movie, you might as well be approaching Satan expecting a hug; although that may well be possible if you greet this films Satanic figures. Take Pitch for instance; the most ineffectual, camp, unhellish portrayal of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep joined forces to create a ten foot Satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms. However, it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever. Seriously, this is no understatement. The same can be applied to every other character, bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent shes probably overcompensating for some serious crime shes part of. Then again, if Santas inter-space recon station is real, there is no chance she could have avoided him this long. Put simply, if you havent seen this movie, you cannot consider yourself a serious buff. The achingly funny characterisation, acting, concept, and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date (if youre after pure laughter that is).","movie"
